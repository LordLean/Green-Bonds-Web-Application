## Intended Usage:
This repository contains a fine-tuned BERT model for the NLP task of **question answering**. 

The pretrained weights and fine-tuning step enable the model to be applied to climate-finance domains.

As such, one may use the upload widget contained within the site to upload a PDF. Textual and tabular content will then be extracted and the user may then query the discovered text to return portions of text deemed relevant to a given query or keyword prompt.

A specific question can then be asked of the discovered texts, and the question answering model will return the answer it believes has best answered the question for a given section of text.
